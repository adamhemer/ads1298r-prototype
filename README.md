# Music From Biosignals

This repo is the code developed for the Music from Biosignals project to run the on-body device. It is centred around the ADS1298R which is a 8-channel ADC for biosignal collection.

## Setup

This project was developed using the now-depreceated Arduino extention for VSCode. It can still be opened and uploaded from the Arduino IDE, ensure that the selected device is the "ESP32S3 Dev Module".

## env.h
